					<p class="paragraph">Despite the lowest unemployment rate in decades, analysts expect technology hiring to continue growing steadily into the 2020s. That’s great news for recent computer science graduates and developers currently working in the field, but that doesn’t mean ambitious engineers can get complacent. While there will likely be growth opportunities in the market overall, there are still significant changes apace and urgency to keep up with the latest trends.</p>
					<br>
					<br>
					<p class="paragraph">Today, there are more types of technical roles than ever before, and a continued proliferation of new languages, frameworks, and technologies. Technical employees that want to get ahead should routinely test and refine their skills. To that end, I’ve put together the following list of platforms where you can level up your skills for any number of roles, from data science to developer operations.</p>

					<a class="siteName" href="https://www.leetcode.com">1. LeetCode</a>
					<img src="img/sites/leetcode.png" alt="LeetCode" class="siteImage">
					<p class="sitePara paraFirst">
						LeetCode has a collection of some of the best algorithm challenges online today. The topics they cover require knowledge of data structures such as binary trees, heaps, linked lists, etc., which is why their challenges are a bit more advanced than some other websites — but the challenges are great if used when preparing for a software engineering interview.
						<br><br>
						They also have a Mock Interview section that is specifically for job interview 	preparation, they host their own coding contests, and they have a great discussion board where people talk about interview questions, jobs, compensation, and other topics related to engineering.

					<img src="img/sites/hackerrank.png" alt="HackerRank" class="siteImage">
					<p class="sitePara paraFirst">
						HackerRank has a large collection of coding challenges tailored towards algorithms and data structures, along with interview prep material, a discussion board for each challenge, and a list of top user solutions. They have challenges for other topics as well like functional programming, AI, Shell, SQL, and more.

					<img src="img/sites/gfg.png" alt="GeeksForGeeks" class="siteImage">
					<p class="sitePara paraFirst">
						GeeksForGeeks(gfg) have everything, core subjects like DBMS, OS Networking to articles and concepts in almost every language.
						<br>
						<br>
						But the best section is their collection of data structures problems. Almost on every topic, they have more than 200 practice problems. The questions also have company tags meaning if a particular problem has come in a tech company exam. Also, they give a score on every question and have a ranking system that offers your rank, which sets a competitive environment and pushes you to do better. Apart from all these, the discussion section is perfect for some help.

					<p class="sitePara paraFirst">
						This is the first time Edabit is appearing on top sites list since 2018 list, 2017 list! It has grown in popularity over the last year, and developers seem to really enjoy the challenges. They offer a large collection of over 4,000 challenges that can be solved online in one of several languages. The site currently only offers online interactive coding challenges — there aren’t any discussion boards, articles, user solutions, or mock interviews like other sites offer, but over time they might be adding some of these.

					<img src="img/sites/freecodecamp.png" alt="freecodecamp" class="siteImage">
					<p class="sitePara paraFirst">
						FreeCodeCamp is a great website for novices and beginners who are just getting into coding. They offer all sorts of resources on learning syntax, practicing coding, building projects, and preparing for interviews. They don’t have as many interactive coding challenges as other sites, but they do offer some fun challenges and interview prep for beginners learning JavaScript.

					<a class="siteName" href="https://codeforces.com/">6. Codeforces</a>
					<img src="img/sites/codeforces.png" alt="codeforces" class="siteImage">
					<p class="sitePara paraFirst">
						Codeforces is now probably the top competitive programming website (where a few years ago TopCoder was where most competitive programmers spent their time). There are problems that you can solve online to practice, but there’s no online editor. Rather, you write your solution in your own editor and then upload it to their system which then tests your code against a suite of test cases.
						<br><br>
						They also frequently hold contests where the best competitive programmers take part in.

					<a class="siteName" href="https://www.codechef.com/">7. CodeChef</a>
					<img src="img/sites/codechef.png" alt="codechef" class="siteImage">
					<p class="sitePara paraFirst">
						The popularity of Codechef is growing every day amongst the coders of every age group. Unlike any other website where there are straight DSA problems like the middle element of an array, reverse a linked list, or any other such standard questions. CodeChef dishes out questions in the form of a problem statement or maybe a story.
						<br><br>
						The problems here require a lot of thinking and trying before coming up to solutions.The gig for which CodeChef is known for is their contests. These contests run every month.

					<a class="siteName" href="https://www.topcoder.com/">8. TopCoder</a>
					<img src="img/sites/topcoder.png" alt="topcoder" class="siteImage">
					<p class="sitePara paraFirst">
						TopCoder is one of the original platforms for competitive programming online. It provides a list of algorithmic challenges from past competitions that you can complete on your own directly online using their code editor. Their popular Single Round Matches are offered a few times per month at a specific time where you compete against others to solve challenges. Here are some topics that their challenges may cover.
						<br><br>
						Aside from solving challenges for fun online, they offer sponsored competitions where you can win prizes for writing the best solution.

					<a class="siteName" href="https://coderbyte.com/">9. Coderbyte</a>
					<img src="img/sites/coderbyte.png" alt="coderbyte" class="siteImage">
					<p class="sitePara paraFirst">
						Coderbyte provides 300+ coding challenges you can solve in an online editor using 10 different programming languages. You can then access official solutions, over 1.5 million user solutions, and read articles on how to efficiently solve the challenges. Coderbyte is recommended by the top coding bootcamps and companies because of its collection of interview prep challenges.

					<a class="siteName" href="https://www.topcoder.com/">10. CodinGame</a>
					<img src="img/sites/codingame.png" alt="CodinGame" class="siteImage">
					<p class="sitePara paraFirst">
						This website is different than the ones listed above because instead of simply solving coding challenges by producing a set of outputs, on CodinGame you write code to actually play a game online. It’s a great website and some of the games are very fun to watch once you’ve written your code. The game graphics are nice and the editor/game UI is very smooth. Overall it’s a great website for beginners to learn coding.
